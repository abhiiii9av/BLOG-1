We have grown up hearing from everyone who has been there that it is ‘Paradise on Earth.’ 
            This enchanting region has long captivated the hearts of travellers with its mesmerising landscapes and rich cultural tapestry. From the tranquil Dal Lake to the bustling bazaars of Srinagar, the region reveals a different aspect of itself each season.     
            This beauty had been on the wishlist for so long and had been overlooked mainly for logistical reasons. We finally decided to make a quick trip in the autumn when crowds are relatively thinner and the weather more temperate.     
            As soon as we landed at the airport with its gorgeous mountain views, we knew everything we had heard about it being heavenly seemed accurate. We kept our trip short, with enough time to relax and enjoy as well. Here’s a glimpse of our sojourn, and I hope it inspires you to visit soon, too.
